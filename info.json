        "description": "Each of Andre's eight sculptures in the Equivalent series consists of a cuboidal arrangement of 120 firebricks. They all are the same in size and shape. The art comes for the controversy it brought, that Equivalent VIII is a textbook illustration of minimal art that should stay in a textbook. No-one should be made to look at it in a gallery.",
